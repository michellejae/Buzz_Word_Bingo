Buzz Word Bingo
A Buzz Word Tracker

You're being asked to write a buzzword tracker that can keep track of buzzwords, the amount of points for a buzzword being spoken aloud, and the total amount of points overall. This system should keep track of at most 5 buzzwords. The intention is to load the system with at most 5 buzzwords and if any of those 5 buzzwords are spoken during a conversation, the matching amount of points is added to a "total point count" managed by the system.

Welcome to Team Buzz™
Our system has been getting a lot of traction and we need to rebuild the API server with NodeJS to handle all the connections, we need you to create the server using ExpressJS. Our CTO will provide you with the specs below.

At this time:

you will not build the front-end.
you will not implement a database.
The Specs
We like RESTful architecture. We like CRUD. As always, data will be sent to the server as x-www-form-urlencoded.

Creating Buzzwords
This is how your buzzword objects should look like after receiving a POST to the URI /buzzword

{
  buzzWord: String,
  points: Number
}
You will store these objects in memory for the time being. Meaning that if the server crashes and after restarting and listening again, your app will have no buzzword objects, no collection containing buzzword objects, no scores, nada.

Routes overview table:

METHOD ROUTE (URI)	BODY	RESPONSE	Action
GET /	empty	render HTML index.html	serves the index.html
GET /buzzwords	empty	{ "buzzWords": [...] } A JSON response containing an array of current buzz words	Retrieves all buzzwords
POST /buzzwords	{ "buzzWord": String, "points": Number }	{ "success": true }	Creates a new buzzword object. Returns true if successful else false
PUT /buzzwords	{ "buzzWord": String, "points": Number }	{ "success": true }	Updates a buzzword's point value. Returns true if successful else false
DELETE /buzzwords	{ "buzzWord": String }	{ "success": true }	Delete a buzzword. Returns true if successful else false
POST /reset	{ "reset": true }	{ "success": true }	Resets the server. All buzzwords are removed and total scores reset to 0
POST /heard	{ "buzzword": String }	{ "totalScore": Number }	Marks that a buzzword has been heard and should update the total score. Returns the new total score if successful otherwise returns just false
Routes detailed
GET /: Serves the static file index.html which should be located in your public/ directory. For now just have a stub HTML file.

GET /buzzwords: Returns a JSON response containing single key, buzzWords which will be an array containing objects (see Buzz Word Object Section for details)

POST /buzzwords: Creates a new buzz word object. The body should have these keys:

buzzWord which contains the buzz word as a String and
points property is how many points that word is worth when scored, this value is of data-type Number. Example: if { "buzzword": "Agile is amazing", "score": 1000 } is sent to this route then the server will create a new buzz word object and add it to a collection.
PUT /buzzwords: Updates a buzz word's points value. The body should contain these keys:

buzzWord which is the buzz word to modify as a String.
points Changes the value of the buzz word's points property, this should be of datatype Number.
Example:
if { "buzzWord": "Social-Mobile", "points": 100 } is sent to this route then the server will find the buzz word "Social-Mobile" and change it's points property to 100. It should then return true. If the buzzword is not found, false should be returned.
DELETE /buzzwords: Deletes a buzz word from the collection.

POST /reset: Reset the total score to 0 and remove all buzzwords from the server.

POST /heard: Increments the total score by the point value assigned to the buzzword given.

Score?
For now, it's up to you on how you keep track of the user's score.

Middleware to use
Body-Parser - Use this module to help parse the data coming from a request. Focus on the urlencodedoptions section of the README, use the extended: true option. Take some time to scan through the documentation. What is body-parser module doing for us? Is this module doing something we previously had to do manually?

Getting Started
Fork and clone this repo.
You'll be using git and npm so be sure to initialize those tools before you use them.
